This is the first assignment in the Odin Project Foundations curriculum. 

This project is intended to tie together everything I have learned thus far in HTML as well as provide me with a skeleton upon which I can continue to advance and practice as a web developer. 

I doubt anyone will be reading this save for me. 

waawaaweewaa!!!
